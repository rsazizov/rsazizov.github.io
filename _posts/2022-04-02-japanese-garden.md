title: Japanese garden
---

Some time ago, I discovered that there's a Japanese garden in Baku. I decided to see it, but it turned out to be somewhat far from where I live. So far, in fact, that it took me 2 years to finally get there. 

It was closed.

The garden is not that big anyways, I could take some pictures from the outside. There were some Sakura trees, and since it's early April, they were blooming in nice soft pink color.
