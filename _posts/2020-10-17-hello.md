title: Hello, World!

I've been meaning to start my own blog for quite some time now. After endless hours of choosing a [theme]([GitHub - andrewhwanpark/dark-poole: Permanent dark(er) theme for Poole](https://github.com/andrewhwanpark/dark-poole)) and couple of git commands, everything is up and running.

## About the Name

**Walking in the Latent Space** refers to the process of exploring the landscapes of a GAN's input space, mentioned in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) which introduced DCGANs to the world. I thought there was something abstract and exotic about the phrase, so I decided to use it as a title for my blog.
