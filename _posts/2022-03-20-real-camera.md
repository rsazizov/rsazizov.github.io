title: I got a real camera
---

I started this blog with a goal to share my life experiences. It's been 17 months and the blog is still empty, which should tell you a bit about my life experiences.

Poor jokes aside, I finally got a real camera (where got = communisted from my job). It's a Sony RX1000 7. It's good, though mediocre at low light, but the camera is not the bottleneck in my case. I watched a whopping 2 hour tutorial on photography. I swear I must've spent twice as much choosing it. Anyways, I learned about exposure triangle and composition and stuff, grabbed _our_ camera and went out to practice the fine art of photography.

I'll leave you with some photos below. I hope they get displayed properly on the first try (upd: they didn't).
